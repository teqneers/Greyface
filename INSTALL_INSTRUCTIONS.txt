0. Prerequisites:
    Greyface is a php and mysql based admin tool on top of sqlgrey. Due to this fact it is required that you 
    download and install sqlgrey in a php/mysql envirenment!

    0.1 Download and install sqlgrey from http://sqlgrey.sourceforge.net/
    0.2 Provide a mySQL installation and combine it with sqlgrey.

1. Deploy the greyface/ folder to a http-accesible folder on your webserver.

2. You have to give read and write access to the Greyface log file in greyface/log/greyface.log
3. You have to give read and write access to the htdocs directory at greyface/htdocs/
4. Configure apache to use the Greyface/htdocs/ directory as root directory.

5. Update/extend the database of sqlgrey with the following database scripts in Greyface/db directory:
    5.1 mysql_create.sql
    5.2 mysql_init.sql
    
    The first script adds 2 tables to your sqlgrey database.
    The second one adds creates a new admin user (usr:admin, pwd: admin). 
    Do not forget to change the password after installation!

6. Make a copy of /Greyface/greyface_template.ini and name it /Greyface/greyface.ini
7. Enter the data in the .ini file to configure Greyface:

            [mySQLData]
            hostname = localhost     <- the url to your mysql database with the sqlgrey table.
            username = user          <- username to login to the database.
            password = xxxx          <- the password which the given user will use to connect to mysql
            dbName = greyface        <- the database name of sqlgrey

            [application]
            sendMail = true|false    <- says if the application can send emails to newly created users
            logging = true|false     <- defines if the error logging to /Greyface/log/greyface.log should be activated



That's it, enjoy!
